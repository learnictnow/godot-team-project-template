- Always close Godot before committing and pushing work to the online repository
- Download all updates before editing project settings
- To keep the development process simplified only one person should work on an individual file at a time. You will need to communicate with each other.
- It is recommended that you put all of your own work in your own folder. Do not edit another person's files or folder.
- Only one person at a time should edit the project settings. These should then be committed and pushed to the online repository as soon as possible.
- Make sure that you commit your work with detailed comments regularly. At least at the end of each lesson.
- You need to commit major milestone checkpoints of your project and document these. For example when the player movement is added.
- Each team member is responsible for managing their own file area.
- There should be a consistent structure across all team members.
